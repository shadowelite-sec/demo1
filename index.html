        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
          According to adherents, the source of the “light” was viewed as being
          directly communicated from a higher source or due to a clarified and
          exalted condition of the human intelligence. To the former class
          belong the Alumbrados (Spanish: “enlightened”) of Spain. Spanish
          historian Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo first finds the name about 1492
          (in the form aluminados, 1498) but traces them back to a gnostic
          origin and thinks their views were promoted in Spain through
          influences from Italy. One of their earliest leaders—indeed, some
          scholars style her as a “pre-Alumbrado”—was María de Santo Domingo,
          who came to be known as La Beata de Piedrahita. She was a labourer’s
          daughter, born in Aldeanueva, south of Salamanca, about 1485. She
          joined the Dominican order as a teenager and soon achieved renown as a
          prophet and mystic who could converse directly with Jesus Christ and
          the Virgin. Ferdinand of Aragon invited her to his court, and he
          became convinced of the sincerity of her visions. The Dominicans
          appealed to Pope Julius II for guidance, and a series of trials were
          convened under the auspices of the Inquisition. Her patrons, which by
          then included not only Ferdinand but also Francisco Cardenal Jiménez
          de Cisneros and the duke of Alba, ensured that no decision was taken
          against her, and she was cleared in 1510.

          After the suppression of Weishaupt’s order, the title illuminati was
          given to the French Martinists, founded in 1754 by Martinez Pasqualis
          and propagated by Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin. By 1790 Martinism had
          been spread to Russia by Johann Georg Schwarz and Nikolay Novikov.
          Both strains of “illuminated” Martinism included elements of Kabbalism
          and Christian mysticism, imbibing ideas from Jakob Böhme and Emanuel
          Swedenborg.
